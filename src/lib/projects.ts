			'Currently, we’re developing a music theory placement exam web application for LSMW. Using MUI’s layout-first approach to CSS and scoped CSS, we implemented our designs twice as fast. The authentication flow, database, cloud storage, and deployment infrastructure were architected with Firebase to deliver reliable performance. For music notation, we chose the VexFlow open-source library for its compact bundle size and fast load times, ensuring an engaging user experience.',
